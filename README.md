# BallRobot

This project contains a robot that chases after white balls. The robot was constructed for Gazebo and the robot's controllers are executable using ROS. Assuming a white ball is in the environment, the robot rotates about its local vertical axis until its camera identifies white pixels in its line of sight. The robot lines up with a white ball and drives forward to pursue the ball.
